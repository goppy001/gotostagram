# README

 I've made first repository like instagram with RailsTutorial in company training.

 original function  
 ・like/unlike and that counter  
 ・picture post form  
   -> without this, you can't post it.  
 ・commentform with ajax  

Now adding  
・hashtag  

Top image borrowed from instagram, so I can change it immidiately if there is a progblem in the use of this of copyrights.
